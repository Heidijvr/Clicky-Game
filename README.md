# React Clicky Game

## Overview 

This is a simple memory challenge game written in React. The application's UI is split into four components.


* The app should render 12 different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

* The app should keep track of the user's score. The score should be incremented when clicking an image; and reset to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should be  reshuffled in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the user has the option to restart via a modal.
